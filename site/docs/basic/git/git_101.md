# What is Git?

Version control is a system that helps software developers manage changes to their code over time. It allows teams to collaborate effectively, track the history of their project, and maintain a backup of their work.

Imagine you're working on a website with a team. Without version control, if someone accidentally deletes a crucial file or introduces a bug, it can be difficult to revert to a previous working state. With version control, you can easily see the history of changes, revert to a previous version, and collaborate with your team without stepping on each other's toes.

### Key Benefits of Version Control

- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously.
- **History tracking**: You can see who made what changes and when.
- **Backup**: Your work is safely stored in a repository.

We will learn more about how Git stores your code, but the first thing you will need to understand is how Git works with a repository's contents and history.


One of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as a **series** of changes. Instead, Git takes a **snapshot** of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a **commit**.

**When you clone a copy of a repository to your local machine**, you receive a copy of the entire repository and its history. This means you can create commmits locally on your machine without needing a connection to the remote, and then sync or push changes when you reconnect.

**When you create a new branch in Git**, create a pointer that corresponds to the most recent commit. Git keeps the commits for each branch separate until you explicitly tell it to merge those commits into a target branch.
