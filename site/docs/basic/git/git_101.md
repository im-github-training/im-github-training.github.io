# What is Git?

Git is a popular version control system used for both open source and commercial software development, with the following unique features:

- **Distributed Version Control**: Unlike centralized version control systems, Git gives every developer a local copy of the entire project history. This means you can create commmits locally on your machine without needing a connection to the remote, and then sync or push changes when you reconnect.

- **Advanced Branching and Merging**: Git's branching model is extremely lightweight and fast, making it easy to experiment with different development paths. 

- **Rebasing and Cherry-Picking**: With Git's advanced features like rebase and cherry-pick, you can alter commit history for a cleaner, linear project history, or pick specific commits to apply to another branch. 


## How Git Works

### The two stage commit

When you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed.

An untracked file is a new file that has never been committed.

Git tracks these files, and keeps track of your history by organizing your files and changes in three working trees. They are Working, Staging (also called Index), and History. When we are actively making changes to files, this is happening in the working tree.

To add these files to version control, we use `git add`, which creates a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. We build this unit in the staging area.

When we are satisfied with the unit of work we have assembled, we create a commit using `git commit`, which will take a snapshot of everything in the staging area.

### Deltas vs Snapshots

One of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as a **series** of changes. Instead, Git takes a **snapshot** of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a **commit**.
