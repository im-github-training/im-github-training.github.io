# Using Markdown

GitHub uses a syntax called **Markdown** to help you add basic text formatting to Issues, Pull Requests, and files with the `.md` extension.

## Commonly used Markdown syntax

### `# Header`

The `#` indicates a Header. `#` = Header 1, `##` = Header 2, etc.

### `* List item`

A single `*` or `-` followed by a space will create a bulleted list.

### `**Bold item**`

Two asterisks `**` on either side of a string will make that text bold.

### `- [ ] Checklist`

A `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.

### `@mention`

When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.

### `#975`

A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.

### `:smiley:`

Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji ID with `:`.
