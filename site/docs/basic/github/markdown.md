# Using Markdown

GitHub uses a syntax called **Markdown** to help you add basic text formatting to Issues, Pull Requests, and files with the `.md` extension.

## Commonly used Markdown syntax

### `# Header`

The `#` indicates a Header. `#` = Header 1, `##` = Header 2, etc.

### `* List item`

A single `*` or `-` followed by a space will create a bulleted list.

### `**Bold item**`

Two asterisks `**` on either side of a string will make that text bold.

### `- [ ] Checklist`

A `-` followed by a space and `[ ]` will create a handy checklist in your issue or pull request.

### `@mention`

When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.

### `#975`

A `#` followed by the number of an issue or pull request (without a space) in the same repository will create a cross-link.

### `:smiley:`

Tone is easily lost in written communication. To help, GitHub allows you to drop emoji into your comments. Simply surround the emoji ID with `:`.

## Introduction to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages enable you to host free, static web pages directly from your GitHub repositories. Several of the projects we use in class will use GitHub Pages as the deployment strategy. We will barely scratch the surface in this class, but there are a few things you need to know:

- You can create two types of websites, a user/organization site or a project site. We will be working with project websites.
- For a project site, GitHub will only serve content from a specified branch. You can also choose to publish your site from a `/docs` folder on the specified branch.
- The rendered sites for our projects will appear at `githubschool.github.io/repo-name`.
