## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a collaboration platform built on top of a distributed version control system called Git. GitHub is focused on developers, the people who code and create software. Our focus is also the people who partner with and employ developers, who are encouraging them to build amazing things.

We do all we can to help unlock the creativity of developers and to foster a community of developers that can come together—as individuals and in teams—to create the future of software and make a difference in the world.

GitHub concentrates on three things:

- Building a technology platform that is like no other, on which developers can create, share and grow the best code possible
- Nurturing a community for developers; a safe and collaborative place that facilitates sharing, amplifies creativity, and supports the principles of open source
- Providing access, opening up a community of opportunity, where new developers can be born and where experienced developers can hone their skills and expand their knowledge

In addition to being a place to host and share your Git projects, GitHub provides a number of features to help you and your team collaborate more effectively. These features include:

- Issues
- Pull Requests
- Projects
- Organizations and Teams
