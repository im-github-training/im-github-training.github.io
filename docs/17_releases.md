## What is a Release?

Releases are a GitHub feature that allow you to add an executable to the tag for easier access by visitors who just want to download and install your software. Releases are tags, because they point to a specific commit and can be named like any other tag. However, releases can also include attached binaries.

### Add a release to GitHub Games

1. On GitHub, navigate to the **Code** tab of the repository.
1. Under your repository name, click Releases.
1. Click Draft a new release.
1. Type a name for the tag. We recommend you use semantic versioning.
1. Select a branch that contains the project you want to release. Usually, you'll want to release against your main branch, unless you're releasing beta software. You can also select a recent commit by choosing the recent commits tab.
1. Type a title and description that describes your release.
1. If you're ready to publicize your release, click Publish release. Otherwise, click Save draft to work on it later.

> Notice that you could drag and drop or select files manually in the binaries box, or select "This is a pre-release" to notify users that it's not ready for production.
