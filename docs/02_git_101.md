## What is Git?

**Git is:**

- A distributed version control system (DVCS)
- Free and open source
- Designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
- Small in size and fast

Git features cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

As we begin to discuss Git (and what makes it special) it would be helpful if you could forget everything you know about other version control systems (VCSs) for just a moment. Git stores and thinks about information very differently than other VCSs.

We will learn more about how Git stores your code as we go through this class, but the first thing you will need to understand is how Git works with your content.

### Snapshots, not deltas

One of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as series of changes. Instead, Git takes a snapshot of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a commit.

### Optimized for local operations

Git is optimized for local operation. When you clone a copy of a repository to your local machine, you receive a copy of the entire repository and its history. This means you can work on the plane, on the train, or anywhere else your adventures find you!
### Branches are lightweight and cheap

Branches are an essential concept in Git.

When you create a new branch in Git, you are actually just creating a pointer that corresponds to the most recent commit in a line of work. Git keeps the commits for each branch separate until you explicitly tell it to merge those commits into the main line of work.
### Git is explicit

Which brings us to our final point for now; Git is very explicit. It does not do anything until you tell it to. No auto-saves or auto-syncing with the remote, Git waits for you to tell it when to take a snapshot and when to send that snapshot to the remote.
