## What is Git?

- A distributed version control system (DVCS)
- Free and open source
- Designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency
- Small in size and fast

We will learn more about how Git stores your code, but the first thing you will need to understand is how Git works with a repository's contents and history.

### Snapshots, not deltas

One of the first ideas you will need understand is that Git does not store your information as a **series** of changes. Instead, Git takes a **snapshot** of your repository at a given point in time. This snapshot is called a **commit**.

**When you clone a copy of a repository to your local machine**, you receive a copy of the entire repository and its history. This means you can create commmits locally on your machine without needing a connection to the remote, and then sync or push changes when you reconnect.

**When you create a new branch in Git**, create a pointer that corresponds to the most recent commit. Git keeps the commits for each branch separate until you explicitly tell it to merge those commits into a target branch.
